/* Connected graph : such graph in which from each vertices we can reach any ohter vertices directly or indirectly
                    Connected graph have only one connected componenets.
                    Connected Componenets more than 1, graph can neber be connected

   Solution : find the no of connected componenets, if the size of array ==1, then graph is conncted
